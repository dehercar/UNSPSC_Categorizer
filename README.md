# UNSPSC_Categorizer

This Tool attempts to facilitate UNSPSC value to a given list of descriptions of industrial part numbers.

First install the following packages in your python environment:

```cmd
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

Then run the NLTK_Requirements.py file to install aditional dependendcies within nltk library.

Finally you just need to fill the description column in the 'Cleaning_Script_Template.xlsx' file of your parts and add a part number column if you wish, it won't affect the behaviour of the categorization algorithm.
